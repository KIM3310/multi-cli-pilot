# Gemini Pilot

Multi-agent orchestration harness for [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) -- prompts, workflows, and team coordination.

## Features

- **15 Specialized Agents** -- Architect, executor, debugger, reviewer, test-engineer, and more, each with a dedicated role prompt.
- **10 Built-in Workflows** -- autopilot, deep-plan, sprint, investigate, tdd, review-cycle, refactor, deploy-prep, interview, and team-sync.
- **Team Coordination** -- Phase-based pipeline (Plan, Execute, Verify, Fix) with quality gates and state sharing.
- **Session Management** -- Configurable approval modes (full / auto / yolo), context injection, and usage metrics.
- **Hook System** -- Event-driven hooks for extending harness behavior.
- **MCP Server** -- Model Context Protocol integration for tool-based workflows.
- **State Persistence** -- JSON-based state, memory, and notepad stored in `.gemini-pilot/`.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20.0.0

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g gemini-pilot
```

Or install locally in a project:

```bash
npm install gemini-pilot
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run via the CLI
gp

# Or use the full command name
gemini-pilot
```
